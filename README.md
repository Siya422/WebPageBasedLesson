# WebPageBasedLesson

This is a webpage based lesson for fundamental concepts in electrical engineering.

**Objective**

Train the students/workers on fundamental concepts in electrical engineering so that they can calculate one variable when the other two variables are given among the voltage, current, and resistance, calculate the voltage across one or more elements within a circuit loop from given voltages in the circuit, calculate the current flow through an element in a circuit from given currents, and recognize the relationship between PV panel output voltage/current and the temperature and sun radius.

**Goal**

Through this Webpage based lesson, the trainee will learn Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), and fundamental knowledge of photovoltaic (PV) panels. The goal of this lesson is to 1) teach the attendees how to apply those principles for design, analysis, and testing in EE through a combination of different types of lecture content (text, equation, figure, video), examples, and quizzes, 2) teach the attendees the basics of PV characteristics including V-I curve, the concept of maximum power point operation, how do temperature and sun radius impact the V-I curve.

**Webpage Outline**

The lesson is a single webpage with 4 major sections covering Ohm’s law, KVL, KCL, and PV panel characteristics, respectively. Questions are designed to be at the end of each section to reinforce the learning when the memory is still fresh. The type of instructional design is more suitable for EE education since the concepts are relatively difficult to understand, it is better to practice right after the concepts are being taught. Each section will have 3 questions to test if the attendees understand the concept.
HTML, CSS, and JS are used for the webpage based lesson development.
